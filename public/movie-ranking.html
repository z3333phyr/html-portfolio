<h1>The Best Movies According to Francis</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>AVATAR</h3>
<p>I love this sci-fi film. The feeling of loosing the ability to walk and when he links to his avatar he can move freely.</p>
<h3>John Wick</h3>
<p>My favourite action film. Starring Keanu Reeves. Retired assasin? His actions are not what you call retired.</p>
<h3>Conjuring</h3>
<p>My favourite horror movie. Better to watch at night, make sure not to scream so loud!</p>
